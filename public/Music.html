                <h2><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKs3bybeTO8">Grow Old With You - Adam Sandler</a></li></h2>
                <p>This song makes my heart feel so calm and happy.<br />
                I really hate that spotify does not have this exact song so<br />
                I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L215z9C4Zd8">Dilaw - Maki</a> as an alternative.</p>              
                <h2><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpG3BxRctQ4">Weightless - All Time Low</a></li></h2>
                <p>All Time Low just gets my Teen Fever running.</p>
                <h2><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dmQ3QWpy1Q">Heavy - Linkin Park</a></li></h2>
                <p>Thank you Linkin Park for being there for all the times I was stuck in that place. I no longer listen to their songs as I already got out but I will always remember how much you helped me. May you rest in peace Chester. </p>
                <h2><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ7mcGWQ78g">Best Day Of My Life - Jesse McCartney</a></li></h2>
                <p>A Cinderella Story ingrained this song on my mind. <br />
                    Whenever I have that slow motion feel in real life, this song runs in my head.</p>
                <h2><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac3HkriqdGQ">You and Me - Lifehouse</a></li></h2>
                <p>The very first song I learned to sing.</p>
